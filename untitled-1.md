## Getting Super Powers

Becoming a super hero is a fairly straight forward process:

```
$ give me super-powers
```

{% hint style="info" %}
&#x20;Super-powers are granted randomly so please submit an issue if you're not happy with yours.
{% endhint %}

Once you're strong enough, save the world:

<pre class="language-bash" data-title="hello.sh" data-overflow="wrap" data-line-numbers><code class="lang-bash"><strong># Ain't no code for that yet, sorry
</strong>echo 'You got to trust me on this, I saved the world' aowidhaowidh aowidhaw oidhawod ihawdoihawdoihawd</code></pre>
